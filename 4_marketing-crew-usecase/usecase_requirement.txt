💡 The Core Idea

You're representing a startup called Autosheet IQ, which develops an AI-powered tool for Excel automation. 
As a member of the marketing and social media team, your role is to generate buzz, promote the product across social platforms and blogs, and drive interest and sales. 
To streamline your efforts, you'll be using CrewAI — a framework designed to build collaborative AI agents that work together like a team — to plan, execute, 
and scale your marketing campaigns.

🧠 What You’re Expected to Do (In Simple Terms)
